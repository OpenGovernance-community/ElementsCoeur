# OpenGovernance

**OpenGovernance** is an open-source initiative exploring how organizations can govern themselves in more conscious, responsible, and human ways.

Rather than proposing a ready-made method or a proprietary framework, OpenGovernance provides a **shared reference of principles, values, and structural insights** that help teams and organizations design governance systems adapted to their context.

This repository is the home of the **OpenGovernance Manifesto**, a living document that evolves through discussion, feedback, and collective contribution.

## What is OpenGovernance?

OpenGovernance focuses on what connects existing approaches to shared governance (sociocracy, holacracy, distributed leadership, living systems, etc.), rather than promoting a new “school” or brand.

It explores:
- governance as a **living system**, not a fixed structure
- the **sovereignty and responsibility** of individuals within a clear collective framework
- the **distribution of power** according to roles and competence
- **tensions and disagreements** as drivers of learning and evolution
- transparency and trust as structural conditions, not moral ideals

A distinctive choice of the project is to open not only tools and templates, but also the **pedagogical content itself**: the reasoning, principles, and conceptual foundations behind governance practices.

## The Manifesto

The **OpenGovernance Manifesto** is the foundation of the project.

It does not describe tools, processes, or step-by-step instructions.  
Its purpose is to:
- articulate a shared vision and posture toward governance
- clarify values and principles
- provide a common reference for all other OpenGovernance resources

The manifesto is intentionally **evolving** and open to contribution.
